* Read The Docs, `Want List <https://django21-tutorial-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/want/index.html>`_

Why? 
=========================

From Django tutorial, we learned 

    python manage.py startapp polls
    
Later on we still need to create urls.py for route.
And, to be production ready, we also need to have templates/polls/base.html, as well as static/polls/style.css.
Why not to provide a much ready templates for startapp?

Something we need to guess to assume first. Then to verify and to adjust.
