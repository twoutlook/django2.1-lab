Django2.1 Tutotrial Lab
====================

* Read The Docs, `Django2.1 Tutotrial Lab <https://django21-tutorial-lab.readthedocs.io/>`_

The main purpose of this project is to practice Django 2.1 `Getting started <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/>`_ effectively.

Like Yoga's daily practice, I need a routine to awaken my body and mind. Same as programming, I need lab to maintain skills to invoke ideas.


Simple is Power
---------------

Repeat practice and find out your weakness. 

You have your right to be an individual thinker.
